IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
1. Always:
  - Wait for explicit user requests before making changes
  - Double-check financial calculations
  - Verify Web3 integration points
  - Consider gas optimization

2. Never:
  - Auto-generate code without permission
  - Make assumptions about blockchain logic
  - Modify existing code without confirmation
  - Skip security validations

3. Security Checks:
  - Validate transaction inputs
